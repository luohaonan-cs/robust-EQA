Setup
###

Download the [SUNCG](https://github.com/facebookresearch/House3D/blob/master/INSTRUCTION.md#usage-instructions) dataset, [House3D](https://github.com/abhshkdz/House3D/tree/master/renderer#rendering-code-of-house3d) virtual environment and install [EmbodiedQA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EmbodiedQA/blob/master/README.md) framework.

Replace all files in the training folder into the project of EmboiedQA.
